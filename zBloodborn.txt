##### Bloodborn - Title History Things #####

NOTE(S):
 - Rulers of kingdoms and empires will have all of the dejure counties of the captial duchy, unless one of its counties is specifically given to someone else.
 - Focus on TITLE hisotry, and just make characters that will be the holders of those titles.
 - Unless specified otherwise, only make the male ruler of a dynasty and the game should auto-generate a family.
 - For now, put ALL OF YOUR character history in one file (so that i can still edit the same files), and i will sort it later
	As a result of this, start from ID 9000 and ill fix those too (dynasties should still be accurate ids)

##= Title History =##
- See Arabia_Map.jpg in mod folder for overview
(Obviously the map will not match the game too well, so if you just give the characters the 
 nearest duchy and the counties that more or less represent the map that will work fine and names can be changed later)
 
P.S. If there aren't enough duchies to match the map, then just have independant counts where needed.
P.P.S. Ignore Oman, I will do that personally, and let me know before you move out of the arabian peninsular.
