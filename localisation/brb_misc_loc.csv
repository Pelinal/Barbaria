BM_ATTILAS_LEGACY_INFO;Just two centuries after the collapse of the Carthaginian Hegemony over the western half of the Mediterranean, the nation states surrounding the European sea now lie shattered and squabble amongst themselves once more. Punic influence is still present in their former trade outposts and colonies. Meanwhile, the last remnants of Attila's great empire now lie in ruins after the most recent civil war which usurped the once ruling clan of Attila and the Hunnic Empire now lies in the hands of a warlord by the name of Ellac the Brute. Will these two once great nations rise again? Or fade into obscurity like so many more before them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
